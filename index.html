          Amy Jade Winehouse (14 September 1983 – 23 July 2011) was an English
          singer and songwriter. She was known for her deep, expressive contralto
          vocals and her eclectic mix of musical genres, including soul, rhythm
          and blues, reggae and jazz. A member of the National Youth Jazz
          Orchestra during her youth, Winehouse signed to Simon Fuller's 19
          Management in 2002 and soon recorded a number of songs before signing a
          publishing deal with EMI.
